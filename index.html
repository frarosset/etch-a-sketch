             the grid occupy the entire space left in the main, while also
             taking into account the aspect ratio of the grid.
             This is done by setting property flex:1 for its children div 
             representing the grid.
             Depending, on the aspect-ratio of the grid, the flexDirection 
             property is set to either row or column, so that the grid grow
             opportunely and is a large as possible.
